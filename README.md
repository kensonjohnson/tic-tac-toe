This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game with a minimalistic UI.
In this project I focused on using modules and factories to keep the namespace clear and utilize private variables. 

## Highlights:
- The X's and O's are generated pusrely with CSS, meaning no weird issues with rendering fonts!
- All of the logic within this app is stored within modules and factory methods, meaning the namespace is clear and variables are essentially private.
- Design is minimal and clean.
